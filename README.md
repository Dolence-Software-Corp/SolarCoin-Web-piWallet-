piWallet for SolarCoin
Modified from Johnathanmartin piWallet.

========

We tested it with solarcoin v 2.1.8 however it was displaying only some parts.
We are waiting for solarcoin v 3.15.1 to be released so that we can attempt to connect to the Daemon again.

piWallet is a secure opensource online altcoin wallet that works with practically any altcoin. piWallet uses PHP, mySQL, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
